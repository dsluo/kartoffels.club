## **What are character textures?**

In FFXIV, the texture assets are divided broadly into:

-   **bg** - background textures
-   **bgcommon** - common background textures
-   **chara** - character textures
-   **ui** - user interface textures
-   **vfx** - visual effect textures
-   **common** - pre-rendered graphics and text textures.

The character textures are inside of the **_chara_** folder.

**chara** is divided into:

-   **accessory** - textures for accessories: ring, necklace, and bracelet slots.
-   **common** - textures for decals.
-   **demihuman** - textures for demihumans like Gaia and beast races.
-   **equipment** - textures for equipment: gloves, boots, hat, shirt, and pants slots.
-   **human** - textures for player races including hair, faces, body, NPC faces and hairs.
-   **monster** - textures for monsters, bosses, some NPCs, minions, summons, and special accessories.
-   **weapon** - textures for weapons and things you hold in your hands like food.

## INSTALLING:

#### **[Installing Penumbra](https://reniguide.info/#installpenumbra)**

I﻿NSTALL MAIN FILES INSTALL ALL UPDATES.

### general install instruction

Just drag the folder out of the archive into your "penumbra mods" folder. Then "rediscover files" on the main "settings" tab of Penumbra. The go to "mods" tab and activate it the mod. Tip: The root folder of a given mod (e.g.: "kart world textures main") will ALWAYS have "meta.json" and "default_mod.json" in it.

### update install instructions

Drag the folder out of the archive on the preexisting folder in the "penumbra mods" folder and say "yes" to overwrites. I.e.: Inside "kart world textures main v1-1-0 update" is folder "kart world textures main". Copy this to your "penumbra mods" folder and overwrite the original "kart world textures main". You will know you did it right if Windows asks "Do you want to overwrite?".

### some more update info
Version numbers work like this: 
 - x.0.0 = major file(more than 40% rewrite), requires complete re-download  
-    0.x.0 = minor update (adds an expansion or large change), install on top of x.0.0  
-    0.0.x = patch update (fixes bugs), install on top of 0.x.0

Example: If Current version is 3.1.2:  

-   If you are brand new: Download 3.0.0, then 3.1.0 update, then 3.1.2 update.
-   If you have version 3.1.0: Download the 3.1.2 update.
-   If you have version 3.0.5: Download 3.1.0 update, then 3.1.2 update.
-   If you have version 2.5.4: Download 3.0.0, then 3.1.0 update, then 3.1.2 update.

Why do you do it like this?  
-   It takes a long to time for users to update if I rerelease the whole thing every time.
-   It takes me a longer time to upload if I rerelease the whole thing every time.
-   It would be difficult to maintain 'All in one', 'latest version complete', and other miscellaneous minor patches at the same time.

**ALWAYS DOWNLOAD THE LATEST VERSION!**

## **Postword**:

My goal is to:

-   Too look functionally the same from a distance but to not become a pixelated smear up close. *﻿ Too not be excessively large. Which is actually really hard to do.
-   To complete this in a somewhat timely manner.
-   To learn some new techniques in regards to manipulating image data.

Because of these restraints,

-   These works will not be as high quality as my various Face Upscales (which are checked individually) or even of images subdivided into subject categories such as SSEUT (characters, landscapes, armors).
-   These thousands of images are processed by being sorted into very broad TYPE categories (such as diffuse, normal, detail alpha, cutout alpha) only.
-   Because I use these as a learning opportunity and new techniques are made every day, expect occasional refactoring (redoing my old work with new techniques.)
