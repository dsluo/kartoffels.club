## **What are world textures?**

##### In FFXIV, the texture assets are divided broadly into:

* **bg** - background textures
* **bgcommon** - common background textures
* **chara** - character textures
* **ui** - user interface textures
* **vfx** - visual effect textures
* **common** - pre-rendered graphics and text textures.

#### The world textures are comprised of the **bg** and **bgcommon** folders.

##### **bg** is divided into:

* **ffxiv** - textures that are local to ARR zones.
* **ex1** - textures that are local to Heavensward expansion zones.
* **ex2** - textures that are local to Stormblood expansion zones.
* **ex3** - textures that are local to Shadowbringers expansion zones.
* **ex4** - textures that are local to Endwalker expansion zones.

##### **bgcommon** is divided into:

* **hou** - player housing textures.
* **nature** - water, moon phases weather, precipitation particle effect, cloud, and star textures.
* **world** - common world textures that are utilized by all zones.

## Downloads:

Downloads are provided: 

* **Torrent**. This requires using a torrent client. I recommend [qbittorent](https://www.qbittorrent.org).
* **Nexus Mods download**. This requires a free Nexus Mods account. I recommend shelling out for premium as free users are capped at 2MB/s down. If you can't/won't pay for premium, I recommend using a download protector like [JDownloader2](https://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) so you don't get a corrupted file after 10 hours.

### **Known Issue:**

\
At a very far distance, lines may appear on some distant terrain. I am working on a fix for this. In the meantime to reduce appearance of lines: ***Set anisotropic filtering to 16x in the game's graphics settings.***

**[Help me find lines, watch this video to learn more.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw12u1zrPY&feature=emb_title)**

### **Postword**:

My goal is to:

* To have world textures of a higher resolution than the original while in cutscenes.
* To complete this in a somewhat timely manner.
* To learn some new techniques in regards to manipulating image data.

\
Because of these restraints,

* These works will not be as high quality as my various Face Upscales (which are checked individually) or even of images subdivided into subject categories such as SSEUT (characters, landscapes, armors).
* These thousands of images are processed by being sorted into very broad  TYPE categories (such as diffuse, normal, detail alpha, cutout alpha) only.
* These works will be released much faster than specific works for the quantity.
* If and when issues are noted, they must be corrected manually. They oftentimes must also be found within the game world.
* Because I use these as a learning opportunity and new techniques are made every day, expect occasional refactoring (redoing my old work with new techniques.)
