## **What are world textures?**

##### In FFXIV, the texture assets are divided broadly into:

* **bg** - background textures
* **bgcommon** - common background textures
* **chara** - character textures
* **ui** - user interface textures
* **vfx** - visual effect textures
* **common** - pre-rendered graphics and text textures.

##### The world textures are comprised of the **bg** and **bgcommon** folders.

##### **bg** is divided into:

* **ffxiv** - textures that are local to A Realm Reborn (ARR) zones. 
* **ex1** - textures that are local to Heavensward expansion zones.
* **ex2** - textures that are local to Stormblood expansion zones.
* **ex3** - textures that are local to Shadowbringers expansion zones.
* **ex4** - textures that are local to Endwalker expansion zones.

##### **bgcommon** is divided into:

* **hou** - player housing textures.
* **nature** - water, moon phases weather, precipitation particle effect, cloud, and star textures.
* **world** - common world textures that are utilized by all zones.

## INSTALLING:

#### **[Installing Penumbra](https://reniguide.info/#installpenumbra)**

I﻿NSTALL MAIN FILES (kart world texture grasses, kart world textures main, and kart world textures common.)
OPTIONALLY INSTALL EXPANSIONS.
INSTALL ALL UPDATES.

### general install instruction

Just drag the folder out of the archive into your "penumbra mods" folder. Then "rediscover files" on the main "settings" tab of Penumbra. The go to "mods" tab and activate it the mod.
Tip: The root folder of a given mod (e.g.: "kart world textures main") will ALWAYS have "meta.json" and "default_mod.json" in it.

### update install instructions

Drag the folder out of the archive on the preexisting folder in the "penumbra mods" folder and say "yes" to overwrites.
I.e.: Inside "kart world textures main v1-1-0 update" is folder "kart world textures main". Copy this to your "penumbra mods" folder and overwrite the original "kart world textures main". You will know you did it right if Windows asks "Do you want to overwrite?".

## **Postword**:

My goal is to:

* Too look functionally the same from a distance but to not become a pixelated smear up close.
  *﻿ Too not be excessively large. Which is actually really hard to do.
* To complete this in a somewhat timely manner.
* To learn some new techniques in regards to manipulating image data.

Because of these restraints,

* These works will not be as high quality as my various Face Upscales (which are checked individually) or even of images subdivided into subject categories such as SSEUT (characters, landscapes, armors).
* These thousands of images are processed by being sorted into very broad TYPE categories (such as diffuse, normal, detail alpha, cutout alpha) only.
* Because I use these as a learning opportunity and new techniques are made every day, expect occasional refactoring (redoing my old work with new techniques.)
