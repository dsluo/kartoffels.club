## Recommended FFXIV programs:

* [xivlauncher + dalamund](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher)
* penumbra - dalamud plugin ([install video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6T-Ro-WOnM))
* RESHADE

> **RESHADE:**
>
> * [Reshade 5.2.1 with addons](https://reshade.me/downloads/ReShade_Setup_5.2.1_Addon.exe)
>
> **RESHADE shader packs:**
>
> When downloading RESHADE there are "effect packages" available in the installer I recommend:
>
> * [qUINT by Marty McFly (Pascal Glicher)](https://github.com/martymcmodding/qUINT)
> * [SweetFX by CeeJay.dk](https://github.com/CeeJayDK/SweetFX)
> * [Insane-Shaders by Lord of Lunacy](https://github.com/LordOfLunacy/Insane-Shaders)
>
> **RESHADE paywalled:**
>
> Pascal Glicher's shader betas are behind a $5 USD paywall. This is where you get "[ray tracing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOPgXRZSvzQ)" for FFXIV: RESHADE RTGI. Also some other neat shaders like Solaris, Regrade, and Clarity. If you can pay $15 USD for FFXIV you can probably buy one month's membership to get the shaders. They work for other games too. If you are too poor or morally opposed to paywalls, I imagine you can find them floating around somewhere.

> **FFXIV UI RESHADE fix:**
>
> * [ReshadeEffectShaderToggler](https://github.com/4lex4nder/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler/releases)
>
> Alex's fix to prevent reshade from applying to the UI in a less borked way than a mask. Works out of the box. Just dump the "ReshadeEffectToggler.addon" (ReshadeEffectToggler_x64.zip) and the "ReshadeEffectShaderToggler.ini" (FFXIVPresetIni.zip)

## Recommended FFXIV visual mods:

All mods below are installed using the penumbra plugin for dalamud/XIVLauncher. I really, really, really recommend using penumbra to control your mods instead of FFXIV TexTools. TexTools is only necessary if YOU want to make mods or edit mods yourself.

These are mods I use to make the game look a bit more modern. I really enjoy the default aesthetic of the game, so I don't change anything drastically from that. All can be found on [XIVmodarchive](https://www.xivmodarchive.com) or [FFXIV nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy14).
The number in front is the priority I set it at in penumbra. Priority determines which is loaded first, which is then overwritten by what is loaded later. Therefore, bigger number OVERWRITES smaller number.

**Equipment:**

* 1 Hrothgar and Viera Hats (nexus)
* 0 NO CID GARLAND DECAL (nexus)

**Body replacers:**

Most older games don't have fingernails or toes due to model budgets and it bothers me. These HD bodies add them. Be aware all but Otopop have NSFW pages.

* 4 The Body SE (SFW version) NSFW page
* 1 Bibo+ (SFW version) NSFW page
* 2 Bibo+ vanilla hands (no spa quality manicures)
* 0 Otopop (SFW lalafel bodies) 
* 4 hrBody (SFW version) NSFW page (Male Hrothgar and Roeg)

**Hands/Feet replacers:**

Since body parts are built into equipment in the game, you must patch all equipment to match the body, if you want it to show while wearing hand/feet pieces.

* 0 koneko mani pedi mega-pack
* 0 the ultimate foot pack
* 1 bibo+ mani-pedi megapack (nexus)
* 1 TBSE mani-pedi megapack (nexus)
* 3 otopop mani-pedi megapack
* 0 Aymeric's Attractive Fingers
* **Face Textures:**
* 3 Face Defined (nexus)
* 3 NPC Defined (nexus)

**Eye Textures:**

* 6 Bright Eyes

**Teeth:**

Like hands and feet, teeth need to be added on a model by model basis. Search xivmodarchive and FFXIV nexus to collect them all! I have a [collection pack on the Nexus with all the Player teeth and some NPC teeth.](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy14/mods/1613)

* 0 Illybites ([xivmodarchive search](https://www.xivmodarchive.com/search?sortby=rank&sortorder=desc&basic_text=illybites&types=1%2C3%2C7%2C9%2C12%2C15%2C2%2C4%2C8%2C10%2C14%2C11%2C5%2C13%2C6))

**My most perfect creations:**

* 4 kart demihuman

* 3 kart equipment updates
* 0 kart face paint textures
* 6 kart NPC teeth
* 5 kart faces
* 4 kart hair 4x compressed
* 5 kart npcs
